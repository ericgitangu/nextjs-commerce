A C2B and B2B e-Commerce app leveraging headless e-Commerce, it contains a full beginning to end user experience including a fully functional checkout with email notifications of orders, purchases etc. I am using Swell as my preferred headless e-Commerce solution. It has the capability of monitoring and keeping track of customers, orders, sales through a variery of APIs offered by Swell on the backend running on a database to house this information, to give it a try use the test credit card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 to experience the user flow.

JAMStack:
-> NextJS bootstrapped with Tailwind for styling
-> Swell
-> Firebase by Google for authentication and Login (TODO)
-> Vercel & Github for CI/CD

Work in progress...
